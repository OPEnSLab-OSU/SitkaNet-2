     * @brief Connect over SSL to a host specified by an IP address.
     * 
     * SSLClient::connect(host, port) should be preferred over this function, 
     * as verifying the domain name is a step in ensuring the certificate is 
     * legitimate, which is important to the security of the device. Additionally,
     * SSL sessions cannot be resumed when using this function, which can drastically increase initial
     * connect time.
     * 
     * This function initializes the socket by calling m_client::connect(IPAddress, uint16_t)
     * with the parameters supplied, then once the socket is open, uses BearSSL to
     * to complete a SSL handshake. Due to the design of the SSL standard, 
     * this function will probably take an extended period (1-4sec) to negotiate 
     * the handshake and finish the connection. This function runs until the SSL 
     * handshake succeeds or fails.
     * 
     * SSL requires the client to generate some random bits (to be later combined 
     * with some random bits from the server), so SSLClient uses the least significant 
     * bits from the analog pin supplied in the constructor. The random bits are generated
     * from 16 consecutive analogReads, and given to BearSSL before the handshake
     * starts.
     * 
     * The implementation for this function can be found in SSLClientImpl::connect_impl(IPAddress, uint16_t).
     * 
     * @pre The underlying client object (passed in through the constructor) is in a non-
     * error state, and must be able to access the IP.
     * @pre SSLClient can only have one connection at a time, so the client
     * object must not already be connected.
     * @pre There must be sufficient memory available on the device to verify
     * the certificate (if the free memory drops below 8000 bytes during certain
     * points in the connection, SSLClient will fail).
     * @pre There must be a trust anchor given to the constructor that corresponds to
     * the certificate provided by the IP address being connected to. For more
     * information check out TrustAnchors.md .
